# Client Project

This exercise is about client communication and planning. You'll learn to use new design tools, plan your work to save development time (though there won't be any coding on this project), and communicate user stories through UML diagrams.

## Learning Objectives
- Define the client’s needs
- Scope the project
- Define User functionalities (login, logout, delete, ...)
- Prepare a UML diagram (for both navigations and actions)
- Prepare a wireframe of the website with for example balsamiq
- Prepare a moqup of the website using a design tool such as Figma
- Communicate the endresult with the client
- Add a quality readme


### Client needs (user stories)


## Briefing
Choose for one of the following clients you'll prepare a website for.

### 1. ZikFreak
Zikfreak needs a website to manage the letting of music studios in Brussels

#### Minimum client demands :

- The landing page shows the ‘featured’ studios and displays them on a map
- A member section for the renting of studios
- An admin section to manage the studios
- It is important to specify the maximum noise allowed in the studio, and also the space and proximity
- To make it easier to search for studios by noise, a user can add instruments to its profile, and the result adapts as follows

This website will look a lot like [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.be/)


### 2. OlaFresco
OlaFresco needs a website for meal orders

#### Minimum client demands :

- The landing page explains the service
- A member section to choose meals
- A member section to keep track of their orders
- An admin section to manage meal deliveries
- Member profile allow to specify user allergies that automatically filter meals

This website will look a lot like [hellofresh](https://hellofresh.com/)


### 3. BeetleTracker
BeetleTracker needs a tool to manage the bugs of IT teams

#### Minimum client demands :

- The landing page explains the service
- A new user needs to belong to a team, can join an existing team/organization or create a new one
- Every team member can invite others in the organization
- Members of an organization add bugs for their team; according to 4 levels of importance (minor, regular, important, ASAP) and can assign the bug to a team member or leave it for later in the main index
- Every team has its own dashboard with an overview of debugging activity
- A member can change the state of a bug from ‘open’ to ‘solved’, the item will automatically be moved to ‘archived’

This website will be a simplified version of [Asana](https://asana.com/)


## Delivering exercise
A main readme which documents the learning objective requirements hosted on a github repository. You can choose either to make use of google drive shared document, markdown, pdf, ..
